                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>The Temple of Literature (Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám) is Vietnam's most important Confucian temple
                        and a powerful symbol of the nation's dedication to education and scholarship. Built in 1070, it
                        served as Vietnam's first national university for nearly 700 years, educating the country's
                        brightest minds and shaping Vietnamese culture around Confucian values of learning and
                        excellence.</p>

                    <p>Today, it stands as one of Hanoi's most beautiful and well-preserved historical sites, offering
                        visitors a peaceful sanctuary from the city's chaos and a window into Vietnam's scholarly
                        traditions. Walking through its five courtyards is like stepping back through centuries of
                        Vietnamese history and culture.</p>

                    <h2>History & Significance</h2>
                    <p><strong>Established:</strong> 1070 AD | <strong>University Founded:</strong> 1076 AD |
                        <strong>Active:</strong> 1070-1779</p>

                    <h3>Foundation and Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Emperor Lý Thánh Tông founded the Temple of Literature in 1070 to honor Confucius, his disciples,
                        and great Vietnamese scholars. Six years later, in 1076, the Quốc Tử Giám (Imperial Academy) was
                        established as Vietnam's first national university, reserved for princes and sons of mandarins.
                    </p>

                    <p>In 1253, the university's admission expanded to include gifted students from across the country,
                        regardless of social class – a remarkably progressive policy for medieval times. This made
                        education more accessible and helped create a merit-based system of government officials.</p>

                    <h3>The Doctoral Examinations</h3>
                    <p>From 1484 to 1779, the temple complex hosted national doctoral examinations (Thi Hội). These
                        rigorous tests in Confucian classics, poetry, and administrative skills determined who would
                        become government officials. Only 1,307 scholars achieved doctoral degrees during this 295-year
                        period – testament to the exams' difficulty.</p>

                    <p><strong>The 82 Stone Stelae:</strong> Beginning in 1484, the names and birthplaces of successful
                        doctoral candidates were engraved on stone stelae mounted on turtle backs. These turtle
                        monuments are now UNESCO-recognized and represent Vietnam's oldest educational records.</p>

                    <h3>Cultural Significance Today</h3>
                    <p>Vietnamese students visit before important exams, seeking blessings for academic success.
                        Stroking the turtle heads is believed to bring good luck and wisdom. The temple appears on the
                        100,000 VND banknote, underscoring its importance to Vietnamese national identity.</p>

                    <h2>Architectural Layout</h2>
                    <p><strong>Total Area:</strong> 54,000 m² | <strong>Style:</strong> Traditional Vietnamese with
                        Chinese influences</p>

                    <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>The temple follows traditional Chinese architectural principles, oriented north-south with five
                        courtyards separated by walls and gates. This layout reflects Confucian cosmology and the
                        hierarchical nature of knowledge and enlightenment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Symmetry and Balance:</strong> Everything is precisely symmetrical, representing harmony
                        and order – fundamental Confucian concepts. The progression through the courtyards symbolizes
                        the journey from ignorance to wisdom.</p>

                    <h3>Key Architectural Elements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Red Lacquered Gates:</strong> Traditional Vietnamese style with gold trim</li>
                        <li><strong>Curved Tiled Roofs:</strong> Decorated with dragons and phoenixes</li>
                        <li><strong>Wooden Pillars:</strong> Lacquered in red with gold calligraphy</li>
                        <li><strong>Stone Walkways:</strong> Ancient stones worn smooth by centuries of footsteps</li>
                        <li><strong>Lotus Ponds:</strong> Symbolizing purity and enlightenment</li>

                    <h2>The Five Courtyards</h2>

                    <h3>First Courtyard - The Entrance</h3>
                    <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Văn Miếu Gate and landscaped gardens</p>

                    <p>Enter through the impressive Văn Miếu Gate (1805) into a peaceful garden The first courtyard
                        serves as a transitional space from the chaotic street to the serene temple grounds. Ancient
                        trees shade gravel paths leading to the second gate.</p>

                    <h3>Second Courtyard - The Scholar's Path</h3>
                    <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Đại Trung Gate (Great Middle Gate)</p>

                    <p>This courtyard represents the journey toward knowledge. Two small ponds on either side symbolize
                        the "ink well" where scholars would grind ink for calligraphy. Students historically
                        contemplated their studies here before entering the examination halls.</p>

                    <h3>Third Courtyard - Thiên Quang Well (Well of Heavenly Clarity)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Feature:</strong> The iconic courtyard with rectangular pond and 82 stone stelae</p>

                    <p>This is the temple's most photographed courtyard. The Thiên Quang Well (actually a rectangular
                        pond) reflects the sky, symbolizing the clarity and purity of knowledge. Surrounding the pond
                        are 82 stone stelae mounted on turtle backs, each inscribed with names of doctoral graduates.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Turtle Symbolism:</strong> Turtles represent longevity and wisdom in Vietnamese
                        culture. These stone turtles have carried the doctoral graduates' names for centuries, ensuring
                        their achievements live forever.</p>

                    <p><strong>UNESCO Recognition:</strong> The 82 stelae were recognized by UNESCO in 2010 as
                        documentary heritage, making them among the world's most important educational records.</p>

                    <h3>Fourth Courtyard - The Ceremonial Hall</h3>
                    <p><strong>Feature:</strong> The Main House of Ceremonies (Đại Bái Đường)</p>

                    <p>Rebuilt in 1954 after French colonial destruction, this hall hosts ceremonies honoring Confucius
                        and Vietnam's greatest scholars. Inside, you'll find statues of Confucius and his four principal
                        disciples, plus ceremonial items including bronze incense burners and ritual instruments.</p>

                    <p><strong>Traditional Ceremonies:</strong> Special ceremonies occur on Confucius's birthday and the
                        Lunar New Year, featuring traditional music and ritual dances performed with ancient
                        instruments.</p>

                    <h3>Fifth Courtyard - The Imperial Academy</h3>
                    <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Thai Học Institute (where classes were held)</p>

                    <p>This final courtyard contained the actual classrooms of the Quốc Tử Giám university. Modern
                        buildings now house a small museum displaying artifacts from the temple's history: ancient
                        books, examination papers, personal items of famous scholars, and photographs documenting the
                        temple through centuries.</p>

                    <p><strong>Museum Highlights:</strong> See original doctoral examination papers, ancient textbooks,
                        and traditional scholarly tools. Displays explain the examination system and showcase portraits
                        of distinguished graduates who became important government officials.</p>

                    <p><strong>Original Number:</strong> 116 stelae | <strong>Surviving:</strong> 82 | <strong>UNESCO
                            Listed:</strong> 2010</p>

                    <h3>What Are They?</h3>
                    <p>Each stele is a rectangular stone tablet mounted on a turtle pedestal, inscription carved in
                        Chinese characters. They record the names, birthplaces, and examination results of 1,307
                        successful doctoral candidates from 82 examinations held between 1442 and 1779.</p>

                    <h3>Reading the Stelae</h3>
                    <p><strong>Top Section:</strong> Examination year and emperor's name<br>
                        <strong>Middle Section:</strong> Names and birthplaces of successful candidates<br>
                        <strong>Bottom Section:</strong> Date of stele erection and sponsor information
                    </p>

                    <p>The inscriptions provide invaluable information about education, geography, and society in
                        medieval Vietnam. Researchers study them to understand historical demographics, education
                        access, and regional development.</p>

                    <h3>Why UNESCO Recognition?</h3>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Missing Stelae</h3>
                    <p>Originally 116 stelae stood here. 34 were lost or destroyed over centuries due to war, weather,
                        and neglect. Some pieces have been found and restored, but many remain lost. The surviving 82
                        are carefully preserved and regularly maintained.</p>

                    <h2>Why Visit the Temple of Literature?</h2>

                    <h3>For History Buffs</h3>
                    <p>Experience Vietnam's thousand-year commitment to education and scholarship. The temple tells the
                        story of how Vietnam built a sophisticated educational system that competed with China's,
                        creating a unique Vietnamese intellectual tradition.</p>

                    <h3>For Architecture Lovers</h3>
                    <p>See one of the finest examples of traditional Vietnamese architecture, beautifully preserved and
                        maintained. The harmonious layout demonstrates classical Asian architectural principles.</p>

                    <h3>For Cultural Understanding</h3>
                    <p>Understand the Confucian values that shaped Vietnamese society and continue influencing modern
                        Vietnam. The reverence for education you'll see in Vietnamese parents bringing children to
                        "touch the turtles for luck" shows how deeply these traditions remain embedded in Vietnamese
                        culture.</p>

                    <h3>For Peace and Reflection</h3>
                    <p>Escape Hanoi's chaos in beautiful, serene courtyards. The temple offers a quiet space for
                        reflection in the heart of the bustling city.</p>
